Route 53

Provide following functions

1) Domain registration- 
allows you to register domain names
2) Domain Name System (DNS) service- 
	- translates friendly domains names like www.example.com into IP 	addresses like 192.0.2.1
	- responds to DNS queries using a global network of authoritative DNS 	servers, which reduces latency
	- can route Internet traffic to CloudFront, Elastic Beanstalk, ELB, or 	S3. There’s no charge for DNS queries to these resources
3) Health checking
	- can monitor the health of resources such as web and email servers.
	- sends automated requests over the Internet to the application to
	verify that it’s reachable, available, and functional
	- CloudWatch alarms can be configured for the health checks to send 	notification when a resource becomes unavailable.
	- can be configured to route Internet traffic away from resources that 	are unavailable

**************************************
Supported Following DNS Record Types
**************************************

A (Address) Format
	is an IPv4 address in dotted decimal notation for e.g. 192.0.2.1
AAAA Format
	is an IPv6 address in colon-separated hexadecimal format
CNAME Format
	is the same format as a domain name

MX (Mail Xchange) Format
contains a decimal number that represents the priority of the MX record, and the domain name of an email server

NS (Name Server) Format
An NS record identifies the name servers for the hosted zone. The value for an NS record is the domain name of a name server.

PTR Format
A PTR record Value element is the same format as a domain name.

SOA (Start of Authority) Format
SOA record provides information about a domain and the corresponding Amazon Route 53 hosted zone

SPF (Sender Policy Framework) Format
SPF records were formerly used to verify the identity of the sender of email messages, however is not recommended

SRV Format
An SRV record Value element consists of four space-separated values.The first three values are decimal numbers representing priority, weight, and port. The fourth value is a domain name for e.g. 10 5 80 hostname.example.com

TXT (Text) Format
A TXT record contains a space-separated list of double-quoted strings. A single string include a maximum of 255 characters. In addition to the characters that are permitted unescaped in domain names, space
is allowed in TXT strings


****************************
Alias resource Record Sets
***************************
- enables routing of queries to a CloudFront distribution, Elastic Beanstalk, ELB, an S3 bucket configured as a static website, or another Route 53 resource record set
- Alias records are not standard for DNS RFC and are an Route 53 extension to DNS functionality
-** Alias records help map the apex zone (root domain without the www) records to the load balancer DNS name as the DNS specification requires “zone apex” to point to an ‘A’ record (ip address) and not to an CNAME
- If an alias resource record set points to a CloudFront distribution, a load balancer, or an S3 bucket, the time to live (TTL) can’t be set; Route 53 uses the CloudFront, load balancer, or Amazon S3 TTLs.

***************************************
Routing Policieis
*****************************************
*****************************************

************************************
Simple Routing Policy
*******************************
- Simple routing policy is a simple round robin policy and can be applied when there is a single resource doing the function for the domain for e.g. web server that serves content for the website


***********************************
Weighted Routing Policy
***********************************

- Weighted routing policy enables Route 53 to route traffic to different resources in specified proportions (weights) for e.g., 75% one server and 25% to the other during a pilot release
- Weights can be assigned any number from 0 to 255
- Weighted routing policy can be applied when there are multiple resources that perform the same function for e.g., webservers serving the same site
- Weighted resource record sets let you associate multiple resources with a single DNS name
- Common use cases include
	- load balancing
	- A/B testing and piloting new versions of software
- Route 53 selects one from the group. Probability of any one resource record set being selected depends on its weight as a proportion of the total weight for all resource record sets in the group for e.g., suppose for www.example.com has three resource record sets with weights of 1 (20%), 1 (20%), and 3 (60%)(sum = 5). On average, Route 53 selects each of the first two resource record sets one-fifth of the time, and returns the third resource record set three-fifths of the time.

******************************
Latency based Routing
*****************************

- Latency-based Routing Policy enables Route 53 to respond to the DNS query based on which data center gives the user the lowest network latency
- Latency-based routing policy can be used when there are multiple resources performing the same function and Route 53 needs to be configured to respond to the DNS queries with the resources that provide the fastest response with lowest latency
- Latency between hosts on the Internet can change over time as a result of changes in network connectivity and routing. Latency-based routing is based on latency measurements performed over a period of time, and the measurements reflect these changes for e.g. if the latency from the user in Singapore to Ireland improves, the user can be routed to Ireland
- Latency based routing cannot guarantee users from the same geographic will be served from the same location for any compliance reason
- Latency resource record sets can be created using any record type that Route 53 supports except NS or SOA


**********************************
Failover Routing Policy
*********************************
- Failover routing policy allows active-passive failover configuration, in which one resource takes all traffic when it’s available and the other resource takes all traffic when the first resource isn’t available.
- Route 53 health checking agents will monitor each location/endpoint of the application to determine the availability.
- Failover routing policy is applicable for Public hosted zones only

***************************************
Geolocation Routing Policy
**************************************
- Geolocation routing policy enables Route 53 to respond to DNS queries based on the geographic location of the users i.e. location from which the DNS queries originate
- Common use cases include
	- localization of content and presenting some or all of the website in 	the users language
	- restrict distribution of content to only the locations in which you 	have distribution rights.
	- balancing load across endpoints in a predictable, easy-to-manage way, 	so that each user location is consistently routed to the same endpoint

- Geolocation routing policy allows geographic locations to be specified by continent, country, or by state (only in US)
- Route 53 returns a “no answer”response for queries from those locations, if a default resource record set if not created
- Two geolocation resource record sets that specify the same geographic location cannot be created
