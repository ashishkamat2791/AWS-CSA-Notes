# Shared Responsibilty Model
 
 * AWS is responsible for portions of the cloud, and you as the customers have portions of the cloud that you are responsible for -thus create Shared security responsibilty.

 * Reduces the Operational burden (on you) as AWS operates,manages and controls the components from the host Operating system and virtualization layer, down to the physical security of the facilities in which the service operate.

*  As the cutomer (you), using AWS means you assume the responsibilty of the guest operating system (including, updates and security patches), other associated applications, software, as well as configuration of the AWS -provided security group firewall.

* You are also responsible for your own coded applications and custom applications built on top of the cloud.
